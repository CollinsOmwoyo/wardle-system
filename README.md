# Clothing Inventory System Frontend

## Project Overview
This project aims to build a fully functional frontend for a clothing inventory system. Currently, the frontend lacks several key features necessary for a complete user experience. Below is an analysis of the missing features and the approach to implementing them.

## Missing Features

### 1. User Authentication (Login/Registration)
- Basic login and registration pages exist but need improvement.
- Lacks validation for user inputs.
- No session persistence (e.g., JWT or local storage handling).
- No logout functionality.

### 2. CRUD for Clothing Items
- No UI for adding, editing, or deleting clothing items.
- No feedback mechanism for success or failure.
- Lacks form validation for input fields.

### 3. Categorization of Clothing Items
- No categorization feature for tops, bottoms, shoes, etc.
- Users cannot filter items by category.
- No category selection in the add-item form.

### 4. Filter and Search Functionality
- No search bar for filtering items.
- Cannot sort items by name, category, or date.
- No real-time filtering for search results.

### 5. Responsive & User-Friendly UI
- Current UI lacks styling, alignment, and spacing.
- Forms are not properly structured.
- No light/dark mode for user customization.
- Tailwind CSS is included but not fully utilized.

## Implementation Plan

### 1. Enhance Authentication System
- Implement authentication state persistence using Vuex or Pinia.
- Improve UI design for login and registration forms.
- Add form validation for secure user input handling.

### 2. Develop CRUD Features for Clothing Items
- Build UI components for adding, editing, and deleting items.
- Provide success/error messages for user feedback.
- Ensure dynamic UI updates after operations.

### 3. Implement Categorization System
- Allow users to assign categories to clothing items.
- Enable category-based sorting and filtering.
- Display items grouped by category.

### 4. Create Search & Filter System
- Add a search bar to filter items dynamically.
- Implement real-time search functionality.
- Provide sorting options for better item management.

### 5. Improve UI & Responsiveness
- Use Tailwind CSS to enhance UI styling.
- Implement a grid/flex layout for better alignment.
- Ensure mobile and desktop responsiveness.
- Add global theming (light/dark mode) for better UX.
